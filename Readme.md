# ✅ Phase I: Problem Identification

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a multi-phase individual capstone project focused on **Oracle Database Design, PL/SQL Programming, and Business Intelligence**.  
The system automates hotel reservations, room allocation, billing, and reporting for hotels operating in Rwanda.

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

Hotels in Rwanda currently face:
- Manual booking processes leading to **double booking**
- **Poor room allocation** during peak seasons
- Lack of **real-time business analytics**
- Weak **security and audit tracking**
- Paper-based reservations causing **customer delays**

These problems result in:
- Revenue loss  
- Customer dissatisfaction  
- Inefficient hotel operations  
- Poor strategic decision-making  

## 🛠 Proposed Solution

A **PL/SQL-based Hotel Reservation & Room Management System** that:
- Automates all booking operations  
- Prevents double reservations using triggers  
- Tracks payments and customers  
- Produces real-time business intelligence reports

# ✅ Phase II: Business Process Modeling

## 👥 System Actors

- **Receptionist** – Registers customers and creates reservations  
- **Hotel Manager** – Monitors performance and pricing  
- **Accountant** – Tracks payments and billing  
- **System Admin** – Manages users and security  
- **Guest** – Makes reservations and checks in/out  

## 🔄 Core Process Flow

1. Customer arrives or books online  
2. Receptionist checks room availability  
3. Reservation is created  
4. Customer checks in  
5. Billing and payment processed  
6. Customer checks out  
7. Audit logs updated
